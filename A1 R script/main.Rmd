## Introduction 

Tuna is one of the most popular fish consumed worldwide and due to its high demand, this can result in them being overfished. Species such as the Yellowfin Tuna​ (Augustinis, 2024)​, Pacific bluefin tuna (Augustinis, 2024)​, and the Atlantic bigeye (Augustinis, 2024)​, are particularly being affected by illegal fishing practices to meet the demands of consumers. Overfishing often leads to a decrease in population, leading to a potential decline in their genetic diversity​ (Sadler, Watts, & Uusi-Heikkilä, 2023)​. However, it can also be possible that some tuna populations could maintain some genetic diversity despite overfishing. This study will use the data available on BOLD to examine the geographic distribution of tuna populations and analyze whether overfishing is significantly impacting the genetic diversity of the tuna species and its surrounding ecosystems.

## Discussion 

The world map (Fig 1.) shows the geographical locations of tuna species that are present across various countries and oceans. This can be seen that tuna species are not localized and any decline in their genetic diversity could cause global effects. As these species are interconnected, a loss of genetic diversity in one region could reduce the species to adapt to environmental changes. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain sustainable fishing practices to avoid any significant negative impact on the tuna species and their ecosystems.  

The PCA graph (Fig 2a.) suggests that genetic variation among the tuna populations is limited based on the clustered points. When taking a closer look at the PCA plot (Fig 2. b) it's easier to define clusters of different tuna species. While some of the points may appear further away, the small scale of the plot implies little overall genetic diversity between these species, Additionally, when looking back at the filtered data from BOLD, samples have different collection sites which may explain the same species have separate points and the outliers that we see if (Fig 2a.). This highlights the importance of having standardized sampling protocols for open source databases such as BOLD to enhance accurate genetic studies. Future research should focus on developing and implementing standard protocols for sampling to facilitate accurate data collection. 

Fig 3. illustrates the number of tuna samples found in each region. Regions with higher sample richness, such as Italy, Cuba, and Mexico may indicate healthier populations or more intensive monitoring. The graph also shows uneven sampling, with lower sampling in other regions. This could indicate there is an incomplete understanding of tuna population in those areas. With fewer samples across these regions, it is possible that these tuna populations could have a higher risk of being overfished due to lack of monitoring. Addressing these genetic gaps could provide a clearer picture of the genetic health of tuna populations and help mitigate the risks associated with overfishing. 

## Conclusion

Based on the data from BOLD, overfishing negatively impacts the genetic diversity of tuna species, potentially making them more vulnerable in their environment. While some tuna populations have high sampling richness, suggesting that there is potential to maintain their genetic diversity, the overall genetic variation between species remains limited. This highlights the importance of enforcing global fishing regulations. Successful regulations in Marseille, France have led to population recovery for Atlantic bluefin tuna, Southern blue fin tuna, albacore and yellowfin tuna (Tuna species recovering despite growing pressures on marine life - IUCN Red List, 2021). However, the tuna stock remains depleted, and it is crucial to uphold strict fishing regulations from further decline. 

Moving forward, further research is also needed to address sampling biases in the BOLD database. As open submission models have a risk of inconsistencies, there should be stricter data validation protocols. This would ensure records are reliable and can help contribute to more informed conservation strategies, ensuring long survival of tuna.
